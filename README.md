## TechGig CodeGladiators Problems

This repository contains solutions to TechGig CodeGladitors contest. Code Gladiators is an annual coding competition by TechGig, that draws the best and the brightest coding talent from all over India. With multiple contests in emerging technologies and the coveted title of Code Gladiators up for grabs, the competition sees enthusiastic participation and has grown from strength to strength with each passing year. In the initial Open Coding Round, there have been 6458 registrations at the time of this writing.
I tried organizing this repository neatly into folders, but I removed them later because Git does not track directories on their own. So I will try to be as descriptive as possible in the README.md and in the code comments.

The first round is an Open Coding Round, where we had to solved two problems which we can solve with whatever langauage of choice (I used Python and C++):

1. Powerpuff Girls 
2. BeyBlade Tournament

The second round has three levels in which we have to demonstrate our expertise in Cloud using the Microsoft Azure Platform:

1. Screening Level
2. Online Hackathon
3. Offline Hackathon

In the first level, we have to register an account on Microsoft Azure and submit a valid screenshot showing that you have taken the necessary steps. In the second level, we have to solve the problem statement given in the Azure Platform and submit the source code as well as a readme.txt and presentation showing the functionalities of your application, the problem it solves and why it should be considered for the final round.
